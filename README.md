Create a WordPress plugin to display new post type : Writers

Create a new “writer” post type
The goal is to create a new post type called “writers”.

When adding a new writer, the edit screen needs to have the following fields:
- First name
- Last name
- Biography
- Facebook URL
- Linkedin URL
- Featured Image


**Writer Single Page:**

Writer single page should be accessed from {website url}/{writer slug}

All of the writer's custom fields should be displayed in a table.

At the bottom of the writer single page, show a section with a grid of 3 cols (using flexbox) of the rest of the writers on the website. Each item in the grid should have the title, featured image and hyperlinked to the writer's page

****Notes**:**
It's ok to not deliver this 100% . I just need to see your coding style, and your comfortability with WordPress.

**Steps to push the Code**
- git clone repo
- git checkout -b {your username}
- Make your changes.
- Commit your changes.
- git push origin {your username}
